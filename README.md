### skipAd.js

This is a way to skip the ads on YouTube with the press of a button (customizabe).
After pasting the code in the console an input element will appear at the top navbar near your profile icon.
Click in the input element and wait until a YouTube advertisement comes on.

The moment the ad comes up you can push the button to skip, without having to wait the standard 5 seconds or so.
If another ad comes on during the same video the one-button-skip will still work.
